### Research

I am a computer science researcher affiliated with the University of Trento.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and automated reasoning,\
with a focus on **probabilistic inference** with **algebraic** and **logical constraints**.

I am currently fully supported by a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action fellowship.\
The project aims at advancing the trustworthiness of AI systems by developing verification tools
that provide formal guarantees on their correctness.
More info [here](/pfv4wmi "pfv4wmi").

As a side project, I am investigating the use of machine learning for the procedural generation of content in games, with a particular interest in functional content (e.g. levels, rules) that must satisfy hard constraints.

### Teaching

I am teaching assistant for the course Foundamentals of AI.
You can find the material [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1IG6U-RgQOhJwt3YoNFHh0Cmqyv1MvvrI "(there)").

I am offering a number of MSc thesis projects on the topics above. Contact me if interested!
